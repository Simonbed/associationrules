### "Hello World"

This is just a preparation script for a homework I have to do for a Business intelligence class. This script finds the results based on the imput criterias

The first algorithm we learned in the class is the association rules algorithm. I found the data online but the data for the homework will be given later

For now, we can see some results . 

I do NOT own the data. The purpose of the data is purely academic. I did not post it publicly since I don't own the rights to it.
